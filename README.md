# Masivian Binary Tree implementation

API to create binary trees and find the common ancestor of the two nodes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

Java 8


### Installing

This is a SprintBoot App so you need to use Maven for build the dependencies.

Something like this

```bash
mvn -i pom.xml
```

And run it as a SprintBoot Application.


When the application finished, you must see the API doc [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### Binary tree parameter
The interpretation of a binary tree for the application is given by a list of numbers.

`` 67, 39, 76, 28, 44, 29, 74, 85, 83, 87 ``

 Each element of the list is a node where the first element is the root of the binary tree and the other elements are the leaves.
 
`Example:[root, node_1, node_2, ... , node_n]`
